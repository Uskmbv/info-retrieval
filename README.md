# info-retrieval

This is our primary code for our Information Retrieval project based
on Anime Dataset subtitle data. We have adapted Professor Liad Magen's code
(https://github.com/liadmagen/Information-Retrieval-Course) and built
a basic index, which includes the anime (as an integer ID), word, and word occurrence
in that anime.

As the project progresses we may include other indicators, so please consider this
as a starting point.
